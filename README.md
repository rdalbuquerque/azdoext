A terminal UI, powered by [bubbletea framework](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbleteahttps://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), to help streamline the process of commiting, pushing, creating PRs and following pipelines in Azure DevOps.

The app is divided into pages:
* git: where you can stage files, commit, push and create PRs
* pipelines: where you can see all pipelines related to the current repository and follow them
* pipeline instance: where you can see the logs and tasks of a specific pipeline run
* help: full instructions

## Usage

- ctrl+b: go back to previous page
