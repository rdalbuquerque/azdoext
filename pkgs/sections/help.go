# azdoext

A terminal UI to help streamline the process of commiting, pushing, creating PRs and following pipelines in Azure DevOps.

The app is divided into pages:
* git: where you can stage files, commit, push and create PRs
* pipelines: where you can see all pipelines related to the current repository and follow them
* pipeline instance: where you can see the logs and tasks of a specific pipeline run
* help: where you are right now

## Usage
### Keybindings
- ctrl+c: quit
- ctrl+b: go back to previous page
- ctrl+h: show/hide help
- ctrl+r: restart the process
- ctrl+s: save on any textarea
	- if on commit message: push
		- if no files are staged, stage all files before pushing
- ctrl+a: stage file on status list
- tab: switch between available sections
- enter: select an option on any list (has no effect on file status list)
- / : search for a string while on pipeline logs


## Commit and push
When the app starts you will see two sections, commit message and the changed files, files staged will be shown in green.\
Here you can either write a commit msg and hit ctrl+s to save, stage all files and push\
You can also stage individual files by pressing ctrl+a while the file is selected.
